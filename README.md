# Introduction
A CMOS inverter is the most basic logic gate built using Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. It consists of a PMOS transistor connected to VDD and an NMOS transistor connected to GND, both sharing a common gate input and a common output node. When the input is high, the NMOS conducts and the PMOS is off, pulling the output low. When the input is low, the PMOS conducts and the NMOS is off, pulling the output high. This inverts the input signal.
The CMOS inverter is a fundamental digital circuit because it operates using two distinct voltage levels to represent binary logicâ€”logic 0 and logic 1. It switches cleanly between these states, making it ideal for digital applications such as processors, memory, and logic circuits. Additionally, it offers advantages like low static power consumption, high speed, and excellent noise margins.
